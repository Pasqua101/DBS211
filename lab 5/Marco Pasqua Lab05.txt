--//PART A â€“ Transactions

--Question 1
--1)The user has established a new connection to the server and has a blank sheet ready to go, starts a new transaction
--
--2)The user uses the BEGIN statement in Oracle SQL, this will start a new transaction
--
--3)The user executes a COMMIT statement, the current transaction is commited, and a new transaction starts.
--
--4)The user executes ANY DDL statement.  This automatically triggers an auto-commit of the current transaction and starts a new transaction.

--Question 2
CREATE TABLE newEmp32
AS (SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE 1=2);

--Question 3
--SET AUTOCOMMIT OFF;
--SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE;

SET AUTOCOMMIT OFF;
SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE;

--Question 4
INSERT ALL
INTO NEWEMP32(EMPLOYEE_ID, LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME, EMAIL, SALARY, DEPARTMENT_ID, MANAGER_ID, JOB_ID, HIRE_DATE)
VALUES (100,'Patel','Ralph','rpatel@mail.com',8500,80,NULL,'Sales Rep',SYSDATE)
INTO NEWEMP32(EMPLOYEE_ID, LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME, EMAIL, SALARY, DEPARTMENT_ID, MANAGER_ID, JOB_ID, HIRE_DATE)
VALUES (101,'Denis','Betty','bdenis@mail.com',8000,80,NULL,'Sales Rep',SYSDATE)

SELECT 1 FROM DUAL;

--Question 5
SELECT * from newemp32;

--Question 6
ROLLBACK;

--Question 7
COMMIT;
SELECT * from newemp32;

--Question 8
UPDATE newemp32
SET job_id = 'unknown';

--Question 9
COMMIT;

--Question 10
ROLLBACK;
--10a)
SELECT * from newemp32
WHERE job_id = 'unknown';

--10b)
--No the rollback was not effective since a commit was issued before the rollback was issued.

--10c)
--The rollback from question 6 changed the table back to what it originally was before the insert and before a commit was used, which was where there was no data in it.
--However, in question 10 the rollback did nothing since commit was issued before I got the chance to use a rollback

--Question 11
DELETE FROM newemp32;

--Question 12
CREATE VIEW vwNewEmp32 AS
SELECT * FROM newemp32 ORDER BY last_name, first_name;

--Question 13
ROLLBACK;

--Question 13a)
SELECT * FROM newemp32;
--No rows were selected, meaning there are no employees in newemp32

--Question 13 b)
--The rollback was not effective, due to it only bringing back the newemp32 table, but with none of the data of the employees in it

--Question 14
INSERT ALL
INTO NEWEMP32(EMPLOYEE_ID, LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME, EMAIL, SALARY, DEPARTMENT_ID, MANAGER_ID, JOB_ID, HIRE_DATE)
VALUES (100,'Patel','Ralph','rpatel@mail.com',8500,80,NULL,'Sales Rep',SYSDATE)

SELECT 1 FROM DUAL;

--Question 15
SAVEPOINT insertion;

--Question 16
UPDATE newemp32 SET job_id = 'unknown';
SELECT * FROM newemp32;

--Question 17
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT insertion;
SELECT * FROM newemp32;
--This rolled back to before the job_id was set to being unknown, so it rolled back to when the data was inserted, as pointed out by the name insertion.

--Question 18
ROLLBACK;
SELECT * FROM newemp32;
--This rolled back to when there was no data in the table

--Question 19
